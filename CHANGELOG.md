## [0.3.0] â€“ _The Alpha_

_2019.09.09_
The first release of `glitchup`, the databender!

It comes with **9** mutation modes, extensive customization, and *(hopefully)* simple instructions.

This is **far** from the final program, but it's still useable, and even satisfactory! If there are more features that you would like, please open an issue, and I'll be happy to address any concerns/ideas.

The performance is ridiculously improved over `BEND++`. Benchmarks will be coming soon. However I would heavily suggest you use `glitchup` over `BEND++` *(unless you'd like to use any of the other* ***9*** *mutations that aren't included with this release)*

I hope you enjoy!

P.S. There are separate binaries for `windows` and `linux`. Make sure you install the right one. Also, `Options.toml` is compulsory. Otherwise you can't really configure it, eh?
